# Connect Four

## Introduction

For years, I've seen lots of Java developers create their version of a Connect Four game.

Players take turns dropping pieces into the vertical game board.  Each piece drops to the bottom of the board or on top the highest piece.  The object of the game is to get four pieces in a row, column, or either diagonal.  Once a player gets four pieces in a row, the game is over.

Here's the GUI I came up with.

Here's the GUI after three games.

The black dots on the yellow pieces mark the four in a row and the end of the game.  The four in a row red pieces are marked with white dots.

This is a two-person game.  The computer does not play in this version.  To drop a piece, left-click above the column you want to drop your piece in.  After a game is completed, the "Restart Game" button will clear the board for another game.
